But if the patient experience breaks down as soon as someone calls        your clinic or lands on your website, that ad spend turns into noise instead of        new appointments.      </p>      <p>Common symptoms look like this:</p>      <ul>        <li>Your phones ring, but many new-patient calls never turn into booked visits.</li>        <li>You have no clear idea which campaigns actually lead to <em>kept</em> appointments.</li>        <li>Your team can&apos;t see, in one place, what came from Google Ads vs. organic search vs. referrals.</li>        <li>Marketing, operations, and clinicians are each held partly responsible &mdash; but no one owns the whole funnel.</li>      </ul>      <p>        In other words, your marketing engine stops the moment someone fills out a form,        clicks &quot;Call now,&quot; or hits your online booking page.      </p>      <figure>        <!-- Image: Simple funnel diagram showing Ads -> Website/Phone -> Front Desk -> EMR -> Revenue -->        <img          src="healthcare-digital-marketing-strategy-funnel.png"          alt="Funnel diagram of a healthcare digital marketing strategy connecting ads, website, front desk, EMR, and revenue"          width="1200"          height="720"        />        <figcaption>          The <strong>Ads&ndash;Desk&ndash;EMR Alignment Framework</strong>: your most valuable optimization opportunities usually live          <em>after</em> the click &mdash; between your front desk and your EMR.        </figcaption>      </figure>      <blockquote class="pull-quote">        <p>Most practices don&apos;t have a traffic problem.

Research on online health behavior shows that a large        majority of adults now use the internet as a source of health information, and        health searches are consistently among the most common online activities.        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_health_communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-running studies of online health communities</a>        and more recent patient surveys        <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/02/health/patients-want-new-tech-in-doctor-visits-new-survey-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show that search engines and medical websites are now a primary starting point</a>        when people look up symptoms or decide where to get care.      </p>      <p>        At the same time, analyses from healthcare call-center providers and patient        access platforms highlight that many organizations miss a meaningful share of        inbound calls during business hours, and that a large proportion of callers faced        with long hold times or unanswered phones simply hang up and may never try again.        <a href="https://www.keonahealth.com/resources/missed-calls-healthcare-call-abandonment-roi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthcare call-abandonment research</a>        and <a href="https://www.dialoghealth.com/post/healthcare-call-center-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">call-center statistics for healthcare</a>        both point to this as a significant source of leakage in the patient journey.      </p>      <p>        That&apos;s wasted marketing spend, lost trust, and missed care.      </p>      <p>        In short: you can&apos;t fix this with more budget alone. You need a different kind of        <strong>healthcare digital marketing strategy</strong> &mdash; one that treats ads, your        front desk, and your EMR as a single system.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="predictable" id="predictable">      <h2 id="predictable">What Predictable Patient Acquisition Actually Looks Like</h2>      <p>        Before we get tactical, it helps to define the outcome you&apos;re designing for.        <strong>Predictable patient acquisition</strong> means you can:      </p>      <ul>        <li>          Set a monthly new-patient target by service line (for example, 40 new physio patients,          25 new cosmetic dermatology consults).        </li>        <li>          Know your acceptable cost per booked patient and lifetime value well enough to          invest confidently in <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/performance-marketing">performance marketing</a>.        </li>        <li>          See, inside your EMR and dashboards, which channels and campaigns are filling          which calendars.        </li>        <li>          Turn the &quot;dials&quot; up or down (budget, campaigns, locations, offers) and watch          patient volumes respond in a mostly linear, repeatable way.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        You don&apos;t get there just by turning on more ads. You get there by treating your        clinic as an <em>end-to-end system</em> and crafting a        <strong>healthcare digital marketing strategy</strong> that connects marketing,        operations, and data.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="foundations" id="foundations">      <h2 id="foundations">Foundations of the Ads&ndash;Desk&ndash;EMR Alignment Framework</h2>      <p>        When we build growth systems for clinics and healthcare groups, we use a simple        rule: <strong>your strategy doesn&apos;t end at the ad account.</strong> It must also        include front desk processes and EMR configuration.      </p>      <p>        We call this the <strong>Ads&ndash;Desk&ndash;EMR Alignment Framework</strong> because it        deliberately connects three pillars:        high-intent ads, trained front desk workflows, and EMR data that closes the loop.      </p>      <p>Five non-negotiable foundations:</p>      <ol>        <li>          <strong>Compliance and trust first.</strong> HIPAA/PHIPA compliance, accurate          claims, and realistic promises. Your content should educate, not oversell. For example,          use resources like the          <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIPAA Privacy Rule guidance</a>          and Ontario&apos;s          <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/guidance-information-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PHIPA information sharing guidance</a>          when you design campaigns and workflows.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Service-line focus.</strong> It isn&apos;t &quot;get more patients.&quot; It&apos;s          &quot;Grow sports medicine by 30% in six months&quot; or &quot;Fill the new pelvic health          therapist&apos;s schedule in 90 days.&quot;        </li>        <li>          <strong>Full-funnel visibility.</strong> From impression to booked appointment to          completed visit, revenue, and retention.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Alignment between ads and operations.</strong> Your campaigns must match          real capacity and preferred booking channels (phone vs. online).        </li>        <li>          <strong>Structured data.</strong> Your EMR and call handling need consistent          fields for referral source, campaign, and key notes so reporting is clean.        </li>      </ol>      <h3>The Core Digital Channels Your Strategy Must Coordinate</h3>      <p>        The Ads&ndash;Desk&ndash;EMR Alignment Framework doesn&apos;t replace core channels &mdash; it        makes them work together. At minimum, your plan should coordinate:      </p>      <ul>        <li>          <strong>Search engine optimization (SEO).</strong> Technical SEO, content, and          on-site UX to capture demand for &quot;doctor near me&quot; and condition-based searches.

Someone chooses keywords, writes copy,        designs creatives, and points everything at a landing page or phone number &mdash; with        little input from the team who actually talks to patients.      </p>      <p>        A stronger <strong>healthcare digital marketing strategy</strong> starts by asking:        <em>How does our front desk really work today?</em>      </p>      <h3>Match Ad Strategy to Real Capacity</h3>      <p>Start with a few deceptively simple questions:</p>      <ul>        <li>Which clinicians or locations have capacity to grow in the next 90 days?</li>        <li>What days and times are hardest to fill?</li>        <li>What appointment types have the highest lifetime value?</li>      </ul>      <p>        Your campaigns, keywords, and geographic targeting should then be designed to        <em>over-feed the areas with capacity</em>, not just drive generic traffic across        the board.      </p>      <h3>Align Call-to-Action With Patient Preference</h3>      <p>        Every campaign needs a primary call-to-action (CTA) that your front desk and EMR        can support cleanly:      </p>      <ul>        <li>          <strong>Call now</strong> &mdash; best when your team can answer quickly during          business hours and has scripts to convert new-patient calls.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Book online</strong> &mdash; best when your EMR or booking tool offers a          mobile-friendly experience and real-time availability.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Request an appointment</strong> &mdash; a softer CTA for specialties where          triage is required, but only if your team can follow up within one business day.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        Choose one primary CTA per campaign and write your ad copy, landing page, and        front desk scripts around that path.      </p>      <figure>        <!-- Image: Side-by-side ad and call script showing matching messaging and CTA -->        <img          src="ad-to-call-script-alignment.png"          alt="Example of a search ad and matching front desk call script for a clinic using an aligned healthcare digital marketing strategy"          width="1200"          height="720"        />        <figcaption>          The message a patient sees in your ad should match what they hear when they call          or what they see on your booking page.        </figcaption>      </figure>      <h3>Use Language Your Front Desk Already Hears</h3>      <p>        The best ad copy often comes from your front desk, not a marketing brainstorm.        Ask your team:      </p>      <ul>        <li>How do patients describe their symptoms or goals in their own words?</li>        <li>Which questions come up in the first 30 seconds of most calls?</li>        <li>What objections stop people from booking right away?</li>      </ul>      <p>        Use those phrases in your search keywords, ad headlines, and landing pages. This        keeps your messaging consistent from the first impression through to the        conversation that actually secures the appointment.      </p>      <p>        When you work with an experienced        <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/performance-marketing">performance marketing agency</a>, share real call recordings and        intake notes so they can build campaigns that reflect day-to-day patient language        and your team&apos;s reality.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="front-desk" id="front-desk">      <h2 id="front-desk">Pillar 2: Front Desk Workflows That Convert Marketing Leads</h2>      <p>        Your front desk is the bridge between marketing and revenue. Even a small        improvement in call handling can transform the ROI of your ad spend.      </p>      <h3>Measure the Right Front Desk Metrics</h3>      <p>Start by tracking a few core numbers:</p>      <ul>        <li><strong>Call answer rate:</strong> What percentage of incoming calls are answered?</li>        <li><strong>Time to answer:</strong> How long does it take on average?</li>        <li><strong>Booking rate:</strong> Of answered new-patient calls, how many turn into appointments?</li>        <li><strong>No-show / cancellation rate:</strong> Especially for new patients.</li>      </ul>      <p>        You can pull some of this from your phone system and the rest from your EMR and        basic call disposition notes.      </p>      <p>        Industry benchmarks and call-center studies suggest that many healthcare providers        miss a notable share of inbound calls, and that a majority of patients who        experience long holds or unanswered phones will either hang up or never try again.        <a href="https://www.keonahealth.com/resources/missed-calls-healthcare-call-abandonment-roi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthcare call-abandonment data</a>        points to this as a key driver of lost revenue and trust. Other research shows        that most prospective patients still prefer to call when booking care, rather than        complete an online form.        <a href="https://metricpoint.ai/post/medical-Practices-missed-calls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analyses of missed calls in medical practices</a>        highlight just how much ad spend can be wasted before anyone ever reaches your providers.      </p>      <h3>Create a Simple Call Flow for Marketing Leads</h3>      <p>        For calls that come from campaigns (Google Ads, Meta, local        <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/search-engine-optimization">SEO</a>), your team should        follow a consistent call flow. Here&apos;s a simple example you can adapt:      </p>      <ol>        <li>          <strong>Greeting:</strong> &quot;Thank you for calling [Clinic]. My name is [Name].          How can I help you today?&quot;        </li>        <li>          <strong>Identify new vs. existing patient:</strong> &quot;Have you visited us          before, or would this be your first appointment?&quot;        </li>        <li>          <strong>Clarify need:</strong> Use 1&ndash;3 simple questions to understand the          issue (&quot;Is this mainly pain, mobility, or performance-related?&quot;).        </li>        <li>          <strong>Reassure and recommend:</strong> Briefly explain how your clinic helps          people like them and recommend the most appropriate service.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Assume the booking:</strong> &quot;We can get you in as early as [Date/Time].          Does that work, or would [Alternative] be better?&quot;        </li>        <li>          <strong>Confirm details and set expectations:</strong> Insurance, location,          parking, what to bring, and reminders.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Capture source:</strong> Log how they heard about you and any campaign          identifiers your EMR supports.        </li>      </ol>      <h3>Give the Team Permission to Prioritize New-Patient Calls</h3>      <p>        If leadership hasn&apos;t said this out loud, your team might treat all calls equally.        That sounds fair, but it can starve your growth engine.      </p>      <p>        Make it explicit that <strong>new patient calls from marketing are priority one</strong>.        Build simple rules, such as:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Always answer calls marked as &quot;New patient&quot; in the queue first.</li>        <li>If you must put someone on hold, it should not be the new patient.</li>        <li>For missed calls from marketing campaigns, return them within 15 minutes whenever possible.</li>      </ul>      <p>        If you are investing in <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/search-engine-optimization">SEO</a> and        <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/performance-marketing">paid media</a>, these rules ensure your        budget turns into booked and kept appointments instead of abandoned calls.      </p>      <figure>        <!-- Image: Front desk team on headsets with a call flow diagram overlay -->        <img          src="front-desk-call-flow.png"          alt="Front desk staff in a healthcare clinic following a structured call flow for new patients"          width="1200"          height="720"        />        <figcaption>          A consistent, patient-friendly call flow turns your ad spend into booked and          kept appointments.        </figcaption>      </figure>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="emr" id="emr">      <h2 id="emr">Pillar 3: EMR and Data That Close the Feedback Loop</h2>      <p>        Your EMR is more than a charting system. It&apos;s the backbone of your patient        acquisition analytics &mdash; if you configure it intentionally.      </p>      <h3>Set Up Basic Source Tracking Inside the EMR</h3>      <p>        At minimum, create standard fields for:      </p>      <ul>        <li>          <strong>Referral source:</strong> Google search, Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram,          walk-in, physician referral, word of mouth, etc.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Campaign or offer:</strong> A short code like &quot;GA-SPRT-APR&quot; for your          &quot;Spring Sports Injury&quot; campaign.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Location / provider:</strong> Where they booked and with whom.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        Your front desk team can capture these during booking. This small extra step        unlocks powerful reporting later.      </p>      <h3>Connect Marketing Data to Revenue, Not Just Leads</h3>      <p>        Many dashboards stop at &quot;conversions&quot; (form fills, calls, bookings). But in        healthcare, you care about <strong>completed visits and revenue</strong>.      </p>      <p>        Work with your marketing partner or internal analyst to regularly pull reports        such as:      </p>      <ul>        <li>New patients by channel and campaign.</li>        <li>Revenue or billings by channel and campaign over 3&ndash;6 months.</li>        <li>Retention and number of visits per new patient by channel.</li>      </ul>      <p>        This is where a data-savvy        <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/search-engine-optimization">healthcare SEO agency</a>        or performance marketing partner can add serious value: tying top-of-funnel traffic        to what your EMR says actually happened.      </p>      <h3>Use EMR Data for Ethical Reactivation and Recall</h3>      <p>        With proper consent and compliance in place, your EMR can also support:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Recare campaigns (for example, annual physicals, follow-up imaging, check-ins).</li>        <li>Post-discharge education and home exercise programs.</li>        <li>Reactivation of patients who haven&apos;t been seen in 6&ndash;12 months.</li>      </ul>      <p>        These initiatives reduce your dependence on constantly acquiring &quot;net new&quot;        patients and increase the lifetime value of the ones you already serve.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="playbook" id="playbook">      <h2 id="playbook">7-Step Healthcare Patient Acquisition Playbook</h2>      <p>        Let&apos;s bring it all together into a concrete sequence you can follow, whether        you&apos;re a single-location clinic or a multi-site healthcare group.      </p>      <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Focus Service Lines</h3>      <p>        Start narrow. Pick one to three service lines where you have both clinical excellence and        capacity. For example:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Sports medicine / orthopedics</li>        <li>Pelvic health physiotherapy</li>        <li>Urgent primary care / same-day appointments</li>        <li>Cosmetic dermatology or aesthetics</li>      </ul>      <p>        For each, define a clear monthly new-patient target and a rough acceptable cost        per booked patient.      </p>      <h3>Step 2: Audit Your Current Patient Journey</h3>      <p>        Put yourself in your ideal patient&apos;s shoes:      </p>      <ol>        <li>Search the way they would (for example, &quot;physiotherapist near me,&quot; &quot;same-day pediatrician&quot;).</li>        <li>Click your ad or organic listing.</li>        <li>Try to call or book an appointment on mobile.</li>      </ol>      <p>        Take notes. Where is it slow, confusing, or inconsistent? Where does the messaging        change abruptly? Those friction points are where your growth is currently leaking.      </p>      <h3>Step 3: Design Campaigns Around Your Operational Reality</h3>      <p>        Work with your marketing lead or agency to build campaigns that mirror your real        capacity and goals:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Geographic targeting that matches your catchment area.</li>        <li>Keywords inspired by actual patient language and EMR diagnosis patterns.</li>        <li>Ad schedules that avoid overloading phones during peak in-person traffic.</li>        <li>Landing pages that clearly match the promise in the ad.</li>      </ul>      <p>        This is where an experienced        <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/search-engine-optimization">healthcare SEO agency</a>        can collaborate with your internal team to align organic and paid search around the        same priorities.      </p>      <h3>Step 4: Build Front Desk Scripts and Training</h3>      <p>        Take your high-priority campaigns and create matching call and email scripts for        new patients. Include:      </p>      <ul>        <li>How to greet callers who mention a specific ad, offer, or condition.</li>        <li>Key talking points aligned with the campaign&apos;s promises.</li>        <li>Objection-handling phrases that feel natural for your team.</li>        <li>Exactly how to record source and campaign codes in the EMR.</li>      </ul>      <p>        Role-play with your team. Listen to a few real calls together each week and coach        toward the ideal script, not a rigid word-for-word reading.      </p>      <h3>Step 5: Configure EMR Fields and Reports</h3>      <p>        Work with your EMR administrator, IT, or vendor to:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Create or standardize referral source and campaign fields.</li>        <li>Build saved reports for new patients by source, provider, and location.</li>        <li>Establish a simple monthly export your marketing partner can use.</li>      </ul>      <p>        Keep it simple at first. You can always add sophistication later once the basics        are consistently captured.      </p>      <h3>Step 6: Launch, Monitor, and Adjust Weekly</h3>      <p>        Once your campaigns, scripts, and EMR fields are in place, launch with a clear        30-day test window. Each week, review:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Impressions, clicks, and cost per click by campaign.</li>        <li>Call volume, answer rate, and booking rate from marketing numbers.</li>        <li>New patients and revenue from priority service lines.</li>      </ul>      <p>        Use these insights to adjust budgets, update scripts, or tweak landing pages.      </p>      <h3>Step 7: Scale What Works, Cut What Doesn&apos;t</h3>      <p>        After 60&ndash;90 days, you should see clear patterns of what&apos;s working. Double down        on campaigns and service lines where:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Cost per booked patient is below your target.</li>        <li>Clinician schedules are filling without excessive wait times.</li>        <li>Patients show up, complete their plans of care, and leave positive reviews.</li>      </ul>      <p>        Reduce or pause underperforming campaigns and reinvest that budget where your        entire funnel &mdash; ads, front desk, EMR &mdash; is already dialed in.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="case-study" id="case-study">      <h2 id="case-study">Hypothetical Example: A 4-Location Physio Group</h2>      <p>        To see how this might play out, imagine a four-location physiotherapy group that        decides to implement the Ads&ndash;Desk&ndash;EMR Alignment Framework in full.      </p>      <ul>        <li><strong>Starting point:</strong> Like many clinics, they already run some Google Ads and          have basic <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/search-engine-optimization">SEO</a>, but they lack a clear view of which campaigns lead to          completed plans of care. Front desk staff feel overwhelmed during peak hours and          rarely capture referral source data in the EMR.</li>        <li><strong>Changes in the first 60 days:</strong> They rebuild campaigns around two priority          service lines, add unique call-tracking numbers to marketing campaigns,          introduce simple front desk scripts, and standardize referral-source and campaign          fields inside the EMR.</li>        <li><strong>Plausible outcomes after 90 days:</strong> In scenarios like this, clinics often          see new-patient booking rates from marketing calls rise significantly &mdash; in some          cases nearly doubling &mdash; while cost per booked patient falls as wasted calls and          no-shows decrease. Provider schedules fill more predictably, and leadership can          finally see which channels are driving the most valuable patients.</li>      </ul>      <p>        This example is illustrative rather than a promise of specific results, but it        reflects what becomes possible when you stop treating ads, front desk workflows,        and EMR data as separate projects and start running them as one coordinated        patient acquisition system.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="90-day" id="90-day">      <h2 id="90-day">90-Day Healthcare Patient Acquisition Rollout</h2>      <p>        To make this feel more manageable, here&apos;s how a typical 90-day rollout might        look for a mid-sized clinic or healthcare group.      </p>      <h3>Weeks 1&ndash;4: Discovery and Setup</h3>      <ul>        <li>Clarify service-line priorities and new-patient targets.</li>        <li>Audit your website, ads, local          <a href="https://www.setsail.ca/services/search-engine-optimization">SEO</a>, and analytics.</li>        <li>Map your current patient journey for one priority service.</li>        <li>Decide on primary CTAs (call vs. online booking) for each campaign.</li>        <li>Define EMR fields for referral source and campaign.</li>      </ul>      <h3>Weeks 5&ndash;8: Launch and Train</h3>      <ul>        <li>Launch or relaunch campaigns aligned to your new structure.</li>        <li>Update landing pages and on-site content for clarity and trust.</li>        <li>Train front desk staff on scripts and new EMR fields.</li>        <li>Begin weekly 30-minute huddles to review calls and early data.</li>      </ul>      <h3>Weeks 9&ndash;12: Optimize and Expand</h3>      <ul>        <li>Shift budget toward best-performing keywords and audiences.</li>        <li>Refine scripts based on real-world objections and questions.</li>        <li>Improve EMR reports and begin tracking revenue by channel.</li>        <li>Roll out to additional service lines or locations once the first is stable.</li>      </ul>      <figure>        <!-- Image: 90-day roadmap timeline visual -->        <img          src="90-day-healthcare-digital-marketing-strategy-roadmap.png"          alt="Timeline graphic of a 90-day healthcare digital marketing strategy rollout"          width="1200"          height="720"        />        <figcaption>          In about three months, most clinics can move from guesswork to a predictable,          data-backed patient acquisition engine.        </figcaption>      </figure>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="agency" id="agency">      <h2 id="agency">When a Healthcare SEO Agency or Performance Partner Makes Sense</h2>      <p>        Some clinics have the internal bandwidth to design and manage all of this.

A dedicated healthcare        digital marketing strategy bakes in compliance, ethical communication, and        sensitivity to clinical workflows, not just &quot;more leads.&quot; It also leans heavily        on accurate EMR data, not vanity metrics.      </p>      <h3>2. Do we need both SEO and paid ads?</h3>      <p>        In most markets, yes. Paid ads help you turn on patient flow quickly and test        messaging. SEO compounding over time gives you a lower cost per acquisition and        stronger visibility for non-branded search terms. The key is coordinating both so        that your <strong>healthcare SEO agency</strong> and paid media team are working        toward the same service-line goals.      </p>      <h3>3. How do we track which patients came from which campaigns?</h3>      <p>        Combine three pieces: proper URL tracking parameters (UTMs), call tracking for marketing        numbers, and standardized referral source fields in your EMR. When these are set        up and your front desk enters data consistently, you can report on new patients        and revenue by channel and campaign.      </p>      <h3>4. What&apos;s a realistic timeline to see results?</h3>      <p>        If you already have some presence and operational capacity, you can often see        meaningful improvements in 60&ndash;90 days &mdash; especially in call handling, booking        rates, and clarity around what&apos;s working. For organic SEO specifically, large        studies from SEO platforms such as Ahrefs suggest that most sites start to see        clear, compounding results over several months, often in the 3&ndash;6 month range and        sometimes up to a year depending on competition.        <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/how-long-does-seo-take/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEO timeline research</a>        reinforces that patience and consistency are essential.      </p>      <h3>5. How do we keep our team engaged with all this change?</h3>      <p>        Involve them early. Show your front desk and clinicians how the strategy supports        their goals: fewer no-shows, better-prepared patients, more predictable schedules.        Celebrate small wins publicly (higher booking rates, positive reviews)        and keep the feedback loops short with regular, focused huddles instead of long,        infrequent meetings.      </p>    </section>    <section aria-labelledby="cta" id="cta">      <h2 id="cta">Where to Go From Here</h2>      <p>        You don&apos;t need a dozen disconnected tactics.
