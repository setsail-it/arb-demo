The rig&#39;s mud pumps were running. The top drive was online. Camp loads were steady. Diesel engines were      humming hard but not yet at their nameplate kilowatts. And yet the microgrid controller kept flashing the      same verdict: <strong>No spare capacity.</strong>    </p>    <p>      The request on the radio was simple—add one more high‑horsepower motor for a new piece of equipment. The      control room said no. The bus was already at its apparent power limit. Any additional load, they feared,      would push the generators into overload and risk a blackout. The only &ldquo;solution&rdquo; anyone could see was a      familiar, expensive one: bring in another generator or start negotiating a costly grid upgrade.    </p>    <p>      What nobody on that shift could see, at least not from the control room, was that poor power factor—something      power factor correction is built to fix—was already burning 20–30% of their usable capacity, hiding in plain      sight in the phase angle between current and voltage.    </p>    <p>      This is what that kind of electrical tuning does for mission‑critical microgrids. It doesn&#39;t add steel.      It doesn&#39;t change your fuel. It doesn&#39;t increase your interconnection size. Instead, it changes the shape      of your power—so you can do more real work with the infrastructure you already have.    </p>    <div class="toc">      <strong>In this article:</strong>      <ul>        <li><a href="#why-full">Why your microgrid feels full long before the generators hit 100%</a></li>        <li><a href="#what-is-pfc">What power factor correction actually is (and isn&#39;t)</a></li>        <li><a href="#capacity-upgrade">How power factor correction becomes a real capacity upgrade</a></li>        <li><a href="#where-lose">Where mission‑critical microgrids quietly bleed capacity</a></li>        <li><a href="#how-implement">Three practical ways to implement power factor correction</a></li>        <li><a href="#smart-pfc">From static banks to smart, automatic power factor control in hybrid microgrids</a></li>        <li><a href="#financial-case">The financial case: a back‑of‑the‑envelope ROI</a></li>        <li><a href="#roadmap">A simple roadmap for evaluating power factor correction on your site</a></li>        <li><a href="#faq">Common questions from operators and engineers</a></li>      </ul>    </div>    <figure>      <!-- Image: Single‑line diagram of a mission‑critical microgrid showing generators, battery storage, and a stepped PFC capacitor bank raising power factor from 0.75 to 0.95 (filename: microgrid-pfc-capacity-diagram.png) -->      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Szb3B7S.png" alt="Single‑line diagram showing power factor correction capacitors unlocking additional real power in a mission‑critical microgrid" width="600" height="500" />      <figcaption>Power factor correction reshapes your apparent power so more of it becomes usable real power.</figcaption>    </figure>    <section id="why-full">      <h2>Why your microgrid feels “full” long before the generators hit 100%</h2>      <p>        If you run <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/oil-gas">oil &amp; gas rigs</a>, operate        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/microgrid-support">mining microgrids</a>, or manage a high‑power        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/ev-charging">EV charging hub</a>, you probably know the feeling.        The operation keeps asking for more: another pump, another conveyor, another fast charger. On paper, your        installed generation or grid interconnect looks big enough. In practice, alarms and protection limits tell        a different story.      </p>      <p>        To understand why, you have to look at how your infrastructure is actually rated. Your generators,        transformers, and grid connection are sized in <strong>kilovolt‑amperes (kVA)</strong>, or apparent power.        Your business, however, runs on <strong>kilowatts (kW)</strong>, or real power—the part that actually performs        useful work: turning drill pipe, crushing ore, or charging vehicles.      </p>      <p>        The ratio between the two is your        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_factor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power factor</a>        (PF):      </p>      <p>        <code>Power Factor (PF) = kW / kVA</code>      </p>      <p>        When your loads are mostly resistive—heaters, incandescent lighting—power factor hovers close to 1.0.        But the real world of motors, welders, VFDs, compressors, and rectifiers is different. Those loads are        inherently inductive or nonlinear. They pull reactive power (<code>kVAr</code>) off the system and push your        power factor down.      </p>      <p>        The result is a kind of optical illusion at the control panel. At a power factor of 0.75, for example,        you hit your 1,000&nbsp;kVA transformer limit when you&#39;re only delivering 750&nbsp;kW of real power. The        missing 250&nbsp;kW worth of capacity is consumed by reactive circulation—current that creates magnetic        fields but does no work.      </p>      <div class="highlight">        <strong>Key point:</strong> Most mission‑critical microgrids reach their <em>current</em> or <em>kVA</em>        limits well before they reach their potential <em>kW</em> output. Low power factor is often the culprit.      </div>      <p>        From the operator&#39;s chair, it simply looks like you&#39;re out of room. In reality, you are often carrying a        20–30% &ldquo;reactive load tax&rdquo; on your installed infrastructure.      </p>    </section>    <section id="what-is-pfc">      <h2>What power factor correction actually is (and isn&#39;t)</h2>      <p>        The phrase <strong>power factor correction</strong> sounds like a software tweak. It isn&#39;t. It is a        deliberate electrical intervention: adding components that supply the reactive power locally so your        generators, transformers, or the grid no longer have to.      </p>      <p>        The most familiar tool is the <strong>power factor correction capacitor</strong>—often shortened to        <strong>PFC capacitor</strong>. Connected in shunt to your system, a PFC capacitor supplies leading        reactive power that cancels out the lagging reactive power of motors and other inductive loads.      </p>      <p>        When properly sized and controlled, the effect is straightforward:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Your power factor rises (for example, from 0.75 to 0.95).</li>        <li>Line current for the same kW falls.</li>        <li>kVA demand on generators and transformers drops.</li>        <li>Voltage regulation improves and thermal margins open up.</li>      </ul>      <p>        In modern systems, this is usually coordinated by an        <strong>automatic power factor controller</strong>. The controller monitors power factor and switches        groups of PFC capacitors in and out in steps, keeping the net power factor near a target (commonly 0.95 or        higher) as loads change.      </p>      <p>        In hybrid microgrids—often orchestrated by        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/">hybrid energy management</a> systems where battery inverters and        advanced converters are part of the architecture—the &ldquo;capacitor bank plus relay&rdquo; model is evolving.        Inverters can act as fast, continuously variable reactive power sources, making power factor correction a        software‑defined function rather than a purely hardware one. But the underlying idea is the same: move        reactive power support as close to the load as possible and take the strain off the rest of the system.      </p>      <p>        What power factor correction is <em>not</em>, importantly, is a magic cure for all power quality problems.        It does not fix harmonics by itself. It does not make undersized cables safe. And it does not change your        mechanical load. It simply lets your existing electrical infrastructure carry that load more efficiently.      </p>    </section>    <section id="capacity-upgrade">      <h2>How power factor correction becomes a real capacity upgrade</h2>      <p>        Capacity upgrades are usually physical. You add a generator. You replace a transformer. You renegotiate a        grid connection. Each step triggers engineering studies, procurement, permitting, and construction.      </p>      <p>        Power factor correction takes a different path. It doesn&#39;t change the kVA nameplate on your gear. Instead,        it changes how much of that kVA can be converted into useful kW.      </p>      <h3>A simple numerical example</h3>      <p>Consider a 1,000&nbsp;kVA generator or transformer feeding a critical bus.</p>      <ul>        <li>At <strong>PF = 0.75</strong>, the maximum real power is: <code>1,000 kVA × 0.75 = 750 kW</code>.</li>        <li>At <strong>PF = 0.95</strong>, the maximum real power is: <code>1,000 kVA × 0.95 = 950 kW</code>.</li>      </ul>      <p>        That is a <strong>26.7% increase</strong> in usable real power, with the same kVA limit and the same        hardware. Push power factor from 0.70 to 0.95 and the available real power jumps by more than 35%.      </p>      <p>        On a drilling rig with several megavolt‑amperes of generation, or on a 5&nbsp;MVA mine substation, those        percentages quickly translate into megawatts of additional headroom—for pumps, hoists, conveyors, or new        fast chargers.      </p>      <h3>Lower current, lower losses, cooler equipment</h3>      <p>        The other side of the story is current. For a given kW, your line current is inversely proportional to        power factor:      </p>      <p>        <code>I ∝ kW / (√3 × V × PF)</code>      </p>      <figure>        <!-- Image: Before/after current vs power factor plot comparing PF 0.75 vs 0.95 on a constant-kW load (filename: pfc-current-reduction-plot.png) -->        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/329ullN.png" alt="Graph showing how an automatic power factor controller raises power factor from 0.75 to 0.95 and reduces line current for the same real power" width="500" height="500" />        <figcaption>Raising power factor from 0.75 to 0.95 cuts current and frees thermal headroom without any new generators.</figcaption>      </figure>      <p>        Improve PF, and current drops. Because copper losses scale with the square of current (<code>I²R</code>),        that seemingly small change in current can yield significant reductions in thermal stress and voltage        drop across cables and transformers. In practice, operators see:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Fewer nuisance trips on overcurrent and thermal protection.</li>        <li>More stable bus voltages under motor starts and heavy cycling loads.</li>        <li>Reduced heating in cables, bus ducts, and transformer windings.</li>      </ul>      <p>        These are not merely &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; features. In mission‑critical environments, they are an insurance        policy that keeps microgrids operating within safe margins even as utilization climbs.      </p>      <div class="callout">        <strong>Why 20–30% is a realistic target</strong>        <p class="small">          Across drilling rigs, mines, and remote industrial sites, it is common to see average power factors in          the 0.70–0.80 range at the main bus. Lifting that to 0.95 with a coordinated power factor correction          strategy routinely unlocks 20–30% more real power capacity—before anyone lays a new cable or ships in          another generator.        </p>      </div>    </section>    <section id="where-lose">      <h2>Where mission‑critical microgrids quietly bleed capacity</h2>      <p>        In theory, you design for good power factor. In practice, systems evolve. Equipment is added and removed.        Loads change duty cycles. VFDs show up in places where across‑the‑line starters used to be. EV chargers        arrive on distribution circuits built for lighting and HVAC. The same story plays out on        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/microgrid-support">remote communities</a> and industrial sites that        rely on islanded microgrids.      </p>      <p>Some of the most common culprits on high‑demand microgrids include:</p>      <ul>        <li>          <strong>Large induction motors</strong> – Mud pumps, drawworks, crushers, conveyors, ventilation fans,          and process pumps often run with lagging power factors, especially at partial load.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Motor‑heavy starting sequences</strong> – Simultaneous starts during drilling or mining cycles can          drag system PF down and stress generators.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Variable‑frequency drives (VFDs)</strong> – While improving process control and mechanical stress,          many VFDs introduce reactive and harmonic currents that degrade the overall power factor seen at the bus.        </li>        <li>          <strong>Welders and rectifier‑type loads</strong> – Common in fabrication yards and maintenance shops,          these can introduce both low PF and significant distortion.        </li>        <li>          <strong>High‑power EV charging infrastructure</strong> – Fast‑charging cabinets and heavy‑duty fleet          chargers often have corrective circuitry, but when clustered, they can still present complex reactive and          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonics_(electrical_power)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">harmonic distortion</a>          to the microgrid. This is especially visible at large          <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/ev-charging">EV charging solutions</a> sites.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        None of these loads is optional. They are central to the mission—moving ore, advancing the bit,        transporting people and equipment. But each of them can be partnered with well‑designed power factor        correction to reduce their invisible tax on system capacity.      </p>    </section>    <section id="how-implement">      <h2>Three practical ways to implement power factor correction</h2>      <p>        Power factor correction is not a single piece of hardware. It is a design approach. In real projects, you        see three broad tactics—often used in combination.      </p>      <h3>1. Local PFC capacitors at large motors</h3>      <p>        The classic approach is to install a <strong>power factor correction capacitor</strong> directly at the        terminals of a large motor or group of motors. Properly sized, this PFC capacitor supplies most of the        motor&#39;s reactive needs locally. The upstream system sees a higher power factor and lower current for the        same mechanical output.      </p>      <p>Advantages:</p>      <ul>        <li>Reduces current in feeders and switchgear upstream of the motor.</li>        <li>Improves voltage at the motor terminals, which can improve torque and reliability.</li>        <li>Simple, well‑understood, and relatively low‑cost.</li>      </ul>      <p>Limitations:</p>      <ul>        <li>          Fixed correction may over‑ or under‑compensate when the motor is lightly loaded or cycling, potentially          pushing local PF above 1.0.        </li>        <li>          Coordination with motor starters, protection schemes, and harmonics must be carefully engineered.        </li>      </ul>      <h3>2. Centralized capacitor banks on main or sub‑buses</h3>      <p>        A second strategy is to use a stepped capacitor bank at a main switchboard or major sub‑bus. An        <strong>automatic power factor controller</strong> monitors bus power factor (and sometimes voltage and        kVAr) and switches groups of PFC capacitors in and out to maintain a target power factor.      </p>      <p>Advantages:</p>      <ul>        <li>One installation can improve PF for many downstream loads at once.</li>        <li>Automatic control adapts to changing load profiles throughout the day or drilling/mining cycle.</li>        <li>Good leverage point for sites with many medium‑sized inductive loads.</li>      </ul>      <p>Limitations:</p>      <ul>        <li>          Does not reduce currents within branch circuits between the bus and individual loads; benefits mostly          accrue upstream of the capacitor bank.        </li>        <li>          Step changes in kVAr can cause small voltage steps; transient interactions must be considered.        </li>        <li>          If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonics_(electrical_power)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">harmonic distortion</a>          is present, detuned or filtered capacitor banks are often required to avoid resonance.        </li>      </ul>      <h3>3. Dynamic, inverter‑based reactive power support</h3>      <p>        In hybrid microgrids with battery energy storage systems (BESS), the inverters themselves can act as a        fast, flexible reactive power source. Modern controllers can command these inverters to hold a target        power factor or voltage at a point of interconnection, behaving like a continuously variable PFC device.      </p>      <p>Advantages:</p>      <ul>        <li>          Very fast response—milliseconds rather than seconds—ideal for stabilizing voltage under motor starts or          rapidly changing EV charging loads.        </li>        <li>          Reactive output can be shaped without introducing the resonance risks associated with large passive          capacitor banks.        </li>        <li>          Integrates naturally with microgrid controls and optimization algorithms.        </li>      </ul>      <p>Limitations:</p>      <ul>        <li>Requires properly sized and configured inverters and DC storage.</li>        <li>          Without a coordinated strategy, inverter‑based support and capacitor banks can &ldquo;fight&rdquo; each other.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        In high‑stakes environments, the most effective designs often combine these tactics: local PFC capacitors        at the worst‑offending motors, a bus‑level bank under an automatic power factor controller, and        inverter‑based reactive support orchestrated by a hybrid energy management system.      </p>    </section>    <section id="smart-pfc">      <h2>From static banks to smart, automatic power factor control in hybrid microgrids</h2>      <p>        Many facilities already have some form of power factor correction installed. A dusty panel in the corner        with a few PFC capacitors and an aging relay. A fixed bank on a main feeder that no one has adjusted        since commissioning.      </p>      <p>        The problem isn&#39;t that these devices exist; it&#39;s that they operate blindly. They don&#39;t understand the        mission‑critical context. They don&#39;t coordinate with generators, battery systems, or protective relays.        And they certainly don&#39;t adapt to changing drilling programs, ore bodies, or charging schedules.      </p>      <p>        A modern approach treats <strong>power factor correction</strong> as a fully integrated control function—not        an afterthought.      </p>      <h3>Data‑driven control instead of static settings</h3>      <p>        In a hybrid microgrid, the energy management system already sees millisecond‑level data from generators,        inverters, and key loads. It knows:      </p>      <ul>        <li>Which generators are online, and at what loading.</li>        <li>Where bottlenecks are forming in transformers and feeders.</li>        <li>How power factor varies with each operating mode and shift.</li>        <li>When critical equipment will start, stop, or ramp.</li>      </ul>      <p>        By giving that same system authority over PFC capacitors and inverter reactive power setpoints, you turn a        static installation into an <strong>automatic power factor controller</strong> that sees the whole grid, not        just one bus.      </p>      <figure>        <!-- Image: Schematic of hEMS, inverters, and power factor correction capacitors coordinated by an automatic power factor controller in a hybrid microgrid (filename: hems-pfc-control-architecture.png) -->        <img src="hems-pfc-control-architecture.png" alt="Hybrid energy management system coordinating inverters and power factor correction capacitors with an automatic power factor controller in a mission‑critical microgrid" width="900" height="500" />        <figcaption>A hybrid energy management system can orchestrate inverters and power factor correction capacitors as a single, fast‑reacting control layer.</figcaption>      </figure>      <p>That enables strategies impossible with stand‑alone banks, such as:</p>      <ul>        <li>          Pre‑emptively raising power factor ahead of known high‑demand events (e.g., a major hoisting cycle or a          block of fast‑charge sessions).        </li>        <li>          Coordinating PFC capacitor steps with inverter reactive output to avoid voltage overshoot or oscillation.        </li>        <li>          Respecting generator minimum‑load and ramp‑rate constraints while still improving power factor.        </li>        <li>          Learning from historical data which feeders and loads hurt PF most, and tailoring correction accordingly.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        In other words, the same intelligence that optimizes fuel burn and battery cycling can also be applied to        squeeze the most real power out of every kVA the site has already paid for.      </p>    </section>    <section id="financial-case">      <h2>The financial case: back‑of‑the‑envelope ROI for power factor correction</h2>      <p>        In mission‑critical operations, &ldquo;Can we make it work?&rdquo; is only the first question. The second—and just as        important—is, &ldquo;Does it pay?&rdquo; Power factor correction is unusual in that it often answers both with an        emphatic yes.      </p>      <h3>Scenario 1: Remote mine nearing its power ceiling</h3>      <p>        Imagine a remote open‑pit mine running on a 5&nbsp;MVA microgrid—very much like the        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/microgrid-support">mining microgrids</a> CleanDesign supports—composed        of diesel/hybrid generators and a battery system. The main process loads bring the average power factor at        the primary bus down to 0.78.      </p>      <p>        At current PF, the site can safely pull about <code>5,000 kVA × 0.78 ≈ 3,900 kW</code> of real power before        hitting its infrastructure limit. To add a new crusher line requiring 700&nbsp;kW, engineering concludes        that the site is &ldquo;out of room.&rdquo;      </p>      <p>        With a coordinated power factor correction project—mixing local PFC capacitors on big motors and a        centrally controlled bank to lift average PF to 0.95—the same 5,000&nbsp;kVA can now support        <code>5,000 × 0.95 = 4,750 kW</code> of real power.      </p>      <p>        That is an additional 850&nbsp;kW of capacity—enough for the new crusher line and a margin for growth—        unlocked without buying a single new generator or upgrading the grid interconnect.      </p>      <p>        If a generator‑based expansion would have cost several million dollars in equipment, fuel logistics,        installation, and permitting, a six‑figure power factor correction project with an integrated automatic        power factor controller can pay for itself rapidly. It also strengthens the business case for deploying        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/oil-gas">oil &amp; gas hEMS</a> and similar hybrid systems on adjacent        assets.      </p>      <h3>Scenario 2: EV charging hub constrained by grid capacity</h3>      <p>        Consider a fleet depot with a 2&nbsp;MVA utility connection. The operator wants to add more heavy‑duty fast        chargers but is told the substation is maxed out. At a measured PF of 0.80, however, that connection is        delivering only 1.6&nbsp;MW of real power at full kVA.      </p>      <p>        If the site can raise its effective power factor to 0.96 through a combination of harmonics‑aware PFC        capacitors and inverter‑based reactive support, the same 2&nbsp;MVA interconnect can deliver 1.92&nbsp;MW of        real charging capacity—a 320&nbsp;kW effective increase.      </p>      <p>        The alternative—waiting years and spending capital on a grid upgrade—would delay electrification goals and        vehicle deployments. Power factor correction offers a way to grow within today&#39;s constraints while those        upgrades are negotiated, especially when combined with        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/ev-charging">EV charging hubs</a> powered by hybrid energy        management.      </p>    </section>    <section id="roadmap">      <h2>A simple roadmap for evaluating power factor correction on your site</h2>      <p>        The specifics will vary from a drilling rig in Saskatchewan to a nickel mine in northern Quebec or an EV        depot outside Toronto. But the basic evaluation steps are surprisingly consistent. Think of them as the        <strong>5‑step PF capacity roadmap</strong> for mission‑critical microgrids.      </p>      <div class="highlight framework">        <strong>The 5‑step PF capacity roadmap</strong>        <ol>          <li>Measure present PF, kVA, and loading at key buses.</li>          <li>Rank loads and feeders that hurt PF most.</li>          <li>Model local, bus‑level, and inverter‑based power factor correction options.</li>          <li>Validate harmonics, resonance, and protection coordination.</li>          <li>Pilot on one circuit, then scale what works site‑wide.</li>        </ol>      </div>      <h3>1. Baseline your power factor and loading</h3>      <ul>        <li>Pull high‑resolution data (at least 1‑minute, ideally faster) for kW, kVAr, kVA, and PF at key buses.</li>        <li>Identify peak‑demand windows and the associated operating modes (e.g., drilling vs. tripping, day vs. night shift).</li>        <li>Note where protection margins are tightest: generator loading, transformer temperatures, feeder currents.</li>      </ul>      <h3>2. Identify the worst offenders</h3>      <ul>        <li>          Rank major motors, VFD groups, welders, and other large loads by their kW and their contribution to low          PF.        </li>        <li>          Look for feeders with especially poor PF during key operating modes; these are prime candidates for local          PFC capacitors.        </li>      </ul>      <h3>3. Model candidate power factor correction strategies</h3>      <ul>        <li>          Work with your engineering team or partners to model adding PFC capacitors at motor terminals, at          sub‑buses, and/or on the main bus.        </li>        <li>          Simulate different step sizes and control strategies for the automatic power factor controller.</li>        <li>          If you have a BESS, explore how inverter‑based reactive support can complement or replace some passive          correction.        </li>      </ul>      <h3>4. Check harmonics, resonance, and protection coordination</h3>      <ul>        <li>          Perform harmonic and resonance studies. In systems with significant nonlinear loads, detuned or          filter‑type PFC capacitor banks may be necessary. Standards such as          <a href="https://blog.ansi.org/ieee-519-2022-harmonic-control-power-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE 519 guidelines</a>          provide useful THD limits for these studies.        </li>        <li>          Review generator, relay, and breaker settings to ensure that improved PF does not inadvertently change          the selectivity or performance of protection schemes.        </li>      </ul>      <h3>5. Pilot, monitor, and iterate</h3>      <ul>        <li>          Start with a well‑instrumented pilot on a single feeder or bus. Verify real‑world gains in PF, kVA          margins, and voltage stability.        </li>        <li>          Integrate PFC control into your hybrid energy management system so that corrections are coordinated with          generator dispatch and battery operation.        </li>        <li>          Use the resulting data to refine step sizes, settings, and expansion plans across the rest of the site.        </li>      </ul>      <p>        The crucial point is this: treat power factor correction as a living control strategy, not a one‑time        hardware install. Microgrids evolve. Your PFC strategy should evolve with them, especially on complex        <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/microgrid-support">microgrid support</a> projects in remote regions.      </p>    </section>    <section id="faq">      <h2>Common questions from operators and engineers</h2>      <h3>&ldquo;Will power factor correction jeopardize reliability?&rdquo;</h3>      <p>        It can, if done crudely. Poorly applied PFC capacitor banks have been known to cause nuisance trips,        voltage flicker, and even resonance with harmonics. That history understandably makes mission‑critical        operators wary.      </p>      <p>        The antidote is engineering and integration. Modern designs combine detuned capacitor banks, harmonic        filters where needed, and inverter‑based reactive support under a coordinated automatic power factor        controller. When this is supervised by a hybrid energy management system that can &ldquo;see&rdquo; the whole grid,        reliability improves rather than degrades.      </p>      <h3>&ldquo;We already have a battery system. Do we still need PFC capacitors?&rdquo;</h3>      <p>        Battery inverters can provide highly effective reactive power support, and in some cases they can carry        nearly all of the power factor correction duty. However, relying solely on inverters for reactive power        can consume headroom that might otherwise be used for real power support during transients.      </p>      <p>        Strategically placed <strong>PFC capacitors</strong> can offload some of that steady‑state reactive work,        allowing inverters to focus on fast, dynamic events. The combination often yields the best mix of        efficiency, stability, and capacity gain.      </p>      <h3>&ldquo;Will power factor correction reduce our fuel and emissions?&rdquo;</h3>      <p>        Indirectly, yes. By improving power factor, you reduce circulating reactive currents and associated losses.        That means less wasted generation for the same delivered kW. In hybrid systems, better PF also lets you run        generators closer to their optimal efficiency sweet spots while battery systems handle peaks and dynamics.      </p>      <p>        The larger impact, however, comes from the capacity it frees up. If power factor correction lets you delay        or avoid adding another diesel generator—or get more work done with the same installed base—the fuel and        emissions savings can be substantial.      </p>      <h3>&ldquo;What about utility penalties for low power factor?&rdquo;</h3>      <p>        For grid‑connected operations, improving PF can also avoid or reduce utility penalties and demand charges        based on kVA. In remote microgrids that don&#39;t see a monthly bill from a utility, the &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; shows up        differently: in higher fuel burn, accelerated maintenance, and blocked growth. The technical remedy is the        same in both cases—effective power factor correction.      </p>    </section>    <section>      <h2>Power factor correction as a strategic lever, not an afterthought</h2>      <p>        When people talk about increasing capacity on mission‑critical microgrids, they almost always start with        new hardware—more megawatts of generation, bigger transformers, fatter cables, larger grid connections. In        many cases, those investments are ultimately necessary.      </p>      <p>        But before ordering more steel, it is worth asking a quieter question: <em>How much of the power we already        have is actually doing useful work?</em>      </p>      <p>        For many drilling rigs, mines, remote communities, and EV hubs, the honest answer is: not as much as it        could be. Poor power factor is an invisible ceiling holding back real power output. Addressing it through        a thoughtful mix of <strong>power factor correction capacitors</strong>, smart controls, and hybrid microgrid        design turns that invisible ceiling into usable headroom.      </p>      <p>        The reward is twofold. Operational teams gain the capacity they need—often 20–30% more real power—without        compromising reliability. Finance and sustainability teams see a pathway to better asset utilization, lower        total cost of ownership, and reduced emissions.      </p>      <div class="cta">        <h3>Explore how much hidden capacity is in your microgrid</h3>        <p>          If your drilling rig, mine, or EV charging hub feels &ldquo;out of capacity&rdquo; but your generators and grid          connection still have apparent power to spare, power factor correction may be your fastest, lowest‑risk          upgrade path.        </p>        <p>          CleanDesign&#39;s <a href="https://www.cleandesign.ca/about-us">CleanDesign hEMS</a> use high‑resolution          data, intelligent control, and configurable automatic power factor control to coordinate PFC capacitors,          battery inverters, and generators.
